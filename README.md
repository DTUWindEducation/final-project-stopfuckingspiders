# Wind Turbine Modelling

Team: [Stop Fucking Spiders]

## Overview

**WindTurbineModeling** is a Python package for simulating the aerodynamic performance of horizontal-axis wind turbines using a steady-state Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model. The objective of this project is to compute key performance metrics—such as power output, thrust, and torque—as functions of wind speed, rotor speed, and blade pitch angle. The package includes tools for loading turbine geometry, solving BEM equations, and visualizing performance across a range of conditions.

## Quick-start guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DTUWindEducation/final-project-stopfuckingspiders.git
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv windturbine
source windturbine/bin/activate  # On Windows use: windturbine\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the Package in Editable Mode

Make sure you're in the root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 4. Run the Interactive Application

```bash
python examples/main.py
```
